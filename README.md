Implementing ML models from scratch in a command line program as a personal learning companion to Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) textbook.

So far, this implements:
- Generating Random Data: sinusoidal function, normal distribution

This is a new project I'm working on as I chip away at the theory in PRML, so I plan to implement a lot gradually, if not everything in the book.
